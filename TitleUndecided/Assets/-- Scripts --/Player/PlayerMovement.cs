// Content:
/// - basic player movement (x, z axis)
/// - slope movement
/// - jumping & double jumping
/// - crouching & walking
/// - full state handler
///
// Note:
/// The PlayerMovement script keeps track of the movementState the player is currently in.
/// For example, as soon as the player starts wallRunning through the WallRunning script, 
/// the state of the player here will be set to MovementState.wallrunning.
/// The PlayerMovement script also handles all speed limitations (maxSpeed of the player), depending on which state the player currently is in.
